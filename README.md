## 02 - Overview + Setup

## Install Terraform

Official installation instructions from HashiCorp: https://learn.hashicorp.com/tutorials/terraform/install-cli

## AWS Account Setup

AWS Terraform provider documentation: https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/aws/latest/docs#authentication

1. create non-root AWS user
2. Add the necessary IAM roles (e.g. AmazonEC2FullAccess)
3. Save Access key + secret key (or use AWS CLI `aws configure` -- https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/install-cliv2.html)

## Boostrap command

`./main.tf` contains minimal configuration to provision an EC2 instance.

1. `aws configure`
2. `terraform init`
3. `terraform plan`
4. `terraform apply`
5. `terraform destroy`

### 08 - Testing

Explains different types of testing (manual + automated) for Terraform modules and configurations.

### 09 - Developer Workflows + CI/CD

Covers how teams can work together with Terraform and how to set up CI/CD pipelines to keep infrastructure environments up to date.
